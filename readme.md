Introduction
============

The Pipeline class and mentionFilter class are proof of concept code based on GitHub's idea of the HTML Pipeline.

Since I liked the idea but GitHub's version is (of course) Ruby based, I decided to "port" the basic concept to a PHP class.
This class is not as extensive as the original, but retains the concept of a Pipeline containing one or more Filters through
which you push text. Since the concept of Filters already existed in Wolf CMS, I believe this would be a simple enough change
to make.

Consider this a soon-to-be-feature in Wolf CMS.
